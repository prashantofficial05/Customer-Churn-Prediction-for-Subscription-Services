#### Customer Churn Prediction for Subscription Services

**Introduction:**
  A comprehensive analysis of customer churn for a subscription-based service (e.g., a streaming 
  platform or telecom) to understand customer behavior, identify at-risk customers, and generate 
  insights for personalized retention strategies.

  **Goal:**
 
   To analyze customer usage data, demographic information, and transaction history to predict customer 
   churn and implement strategies to retain high-risk customers.

**Description:**
  The project utilizes customer churn data to:
   - **Clean and Preprocess the Data:** Handle missing values, drop irrelevant columns, and encode 
         categorical variables.
   - **Feature Engineering:** Create features such as usage frequency, time since last login, and 
         sentiment analysis from customer support interactions.
   - **Analyze Customer Churn Patterns:** Examine patterns of churn among different demographic groups 
         and usage behaviors.
   - **Build Churn Prediction Model:** Train classification models such as Logistic Regression, Decision 
         Trees, and Gradient Boosting for churn prediction.
   - **Evaluate Model Performance:** Assess model accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC score to 
         understand the effectiveness of the churn prediction model.
     
**Skills:**
   - Data Analysis: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn).
   - Data Visualization: Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn).
   - Machine Learning: Scikit-learn for building and evaluating models.
   - Tools: Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization.
     
**Metrics:**
   - Churn Rate: Percentage of customers who churned during the observation period.
   - Model Performance: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC score of classification 
       models.
   - Feature Importance: Identification of key features that influence customer churn.
   
**Summary:**
   
  The analysis revealed significant patterns in customer behavior that correlate with churn, helping to 
  identify high-risk customers. The classification models demonstrated good accuracy, with Gradient 
  Boosting being the most effective model. Recommendations include targeted marketing campaigns for at- 
  risk customers and enhancements to customer service based on insights from customer interactions.

**Next Steps:**
   - **Improve Model Accuracy:** Experiment with more advanced algorithms like Random Forest or XGBoost, 
       and consider hyperparameter tuning.
   - **Deploy the Model:** Build a web application using Flask or Streamlit for real-time churn 
       prediction.
   - **Extend Analysis:** Incorporate additional data sources such as customer feedback, social media 
       interactions, and competitive analysis for deeper insights into churn drivers.
